# Phase 1 Project Description


![awesome](![Welcome](minions-363019__340.jpg)

In this project I will explore data from differnt source which all render movie services and come up with recommendation on how how new entity can venture into movie studios. This will greatly help microsoft who are interested in venturing in this new sector!

In this project description, we will cover:

* [***Project Overview:***](#project-overview) the project goal, audience, and dataset
* [***Deliverables:***](#deliverables) the specific items you are required to produce for this project
* [***Getting Started:***](#getting-started) guidance for how to begin our first studio

## Project Overview

For this project,I will use exploratory data analysis to generate insights for a business stakeholder.

### Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. I am in charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. I will  translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

### The Data

In the folder `zippedData` are movie datasets from:

* [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)
* [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)
* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/)
* [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
* [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)

Because it was collected from various locations, the different files have different formats. Some are compressed CSV (comma-separated values) or TSV (tab-separated values) files that can be opened using spreadsheet software or `pd.read_csv`, while the data from IMDB is located in a SQLite database.

Note that the above diagram shows ONLY the IMDB data. 

* `im.db.zip`
  * Zipped SQLite database 
  * `movie_basics` and `movie_ratings` tables are most relevant
* `bom.movie_gross.csv.gz`
  * Compressed CSV file (you can open without expanding the file using `pd.read_csv`)

### Key Points




There are three deliverables for this project:

* A **non-technical presentation**
* A **Jupyter Notebook**
* A **GitHub repository**

I have done the analysis using jupyter pandas and from the prepared presentaion is a wel outlined analysis.
## Summary

This project have given me opportunity to give insights that can be used by microsoft.
